# Dog-Lover App

This is a simple application having 2 screens 
 ###### 1. Home screen 
 ###### 2. Image screen 


Home screen contains a good UI and a button. Button initalises an API call, in successful response it contains a url to a image. This url is used to show an image in the next Image screen. 

Home screen will show a loader while fetching data from internet. When the network call is success then image url in response will pass to the next screen 

Image scren will show a network image that is fetched using image url passed from home screen 

Image screen can toggle its background colour between white and black by tapping on the image same as in a simple gallery application
